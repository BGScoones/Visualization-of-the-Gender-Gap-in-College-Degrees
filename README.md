## Visualization-of-the-Gender-Gap-in-College-Degrees

In this project, I visualize the gender gap in college degrees using line graphs. The goal of this project was to make the data as presentable as possible, so numerous changes were made to the graphs themselves, including:
  - Removing x ticks and labels
  - Removing unnecessary y ticks and labels
  - Removing graph spines
  - Removing legends and labelling lines directly
  - Plotting multiple graphs side by side to make comparison easy, and later grouping graphs according to their types
  - Maintaining a consistent scale (x and y ranges)
  - Using colours suitable for viewing by those with colour-blindness
  - Adding horizontal lines to indicate important import thresholds
